Question 6:
Compare the output of your new program to the output you got by running the original version. 
Are the lines printed in the same order? Why or why not?

The output of the program is different because we are now calling the observer display functions in
a different order than they originally were initialized.

Question 7:
Can you modify the code so that the various XXXDisplay classes are all implementations of the same
interface? Why might or might not this be a good idea?

Yes, we can do this by making the methods of the HeatIndex and CurrentConditions Display non-static and moving
the display functions to the interface. This is a good idea because it will force all subsequent observers to
inherit the method and provide their own implementation of the function. Additionally, we can probably assume that we only
want the display methods called if we have explicity created an instance of their respective class.
